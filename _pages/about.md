Greetings! I am Marion, a dedicated data scientist and analyst specializing in the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and cognitive psychology. With a diverse educational background encompassing psychology and biology and specialization in metaphor appreciation and aesthetics during my Ph.D. years, I bring a unique blend of interdisciplinary expertise. Join me as I share my journey and passion for leveraging Keras, TensorFlow, and Transformers to unlock the mysteries of language and cognition.

My journey began with a genuine curiosity about the human mind's and language's intricacies. 

Literature has long captivated me, serving as a portal to real and imagined worlds. From prose to poems, the written word can evoke emotions, spark creativity, and transport readers to distant lands. As a passionate advocate for the intersection of cognitive psychology and literature, I am deeply intrigued by the phenomenon of immersive reading and the cognitive processes underlying our engagement with literary language.

This curiosity led me to pursue a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology, where I focused on literature appreciation, poetry reading, and metaphor recognition and appreciation. Through rigorous research and exploration, I gained invaluable insights into the cognitive processes underlying language comprehension and interpretation.

Driven by a desire to bridge theory with practical application, I transitioned into the dynamic fields of NLP and Machine Learning. Inspired by my cognitive psychology and aesthetics background, I want to use these amazing technologies to unravel the mysteries of language and creativity. With Keras, TensorFlow, and the rise of Transformers models as my tools of choice, I embarked on a quest to explore the depths of language processing and computational linguistics.

I am excited about the opportunities. With a passion for interdisciplinary exploration, a dedication to excellence, and a commitment to making a meaningful impact, I invite you to join me in deciphering the mysteries of language and cognition. Let us explore minds and machines together, forging new pathways of understanding and creativity in the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

Thank you for joining me on this exhilarating adventure. 
Let's explore and create new things together!
