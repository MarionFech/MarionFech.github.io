I am a PHD student in quest of new challenges and adventures. I am flowing between cognitive psychology and new tools of Natural Language Processing to better understand written messages. I am really interested to convey easy to understand tools for better understanding of anything that a human wrote. There are so many written messages that we can use to better understand our brain, our society, our relationships, and how we perceive others, emotions, and beauty.
